        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The cloud storage market is huge with multiple big-name competitors like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. It is projected that by 2022, more than 72% of the global organizations will migrate to the cloud from on-premise data centers.
          But the market is still young and there is scope for a new entrant. The <strong>purpose</strong> of this project is to identify the right market for a new entrant and design a cloud storage service from scratch with relevant features for
          that
          market.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Though this market is dominated by big names, Most of these platforms have an <strong>unintuitive design</strong> . There are many online forums and twitter rants which reflect this issue. When I carried out a survey to find out what
            users
            wanted to see in a new cloud storage product, more than any fancy feature, their main concern was the usability of existing basic features.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <div class="solution marginbottomsmall">
          <p>Flono prioritizes usability over everything else. To achieve this, the service is designed to provide an intuitive workflow by focusing on the foundations of intuitive design such as visibility, feedback, constraints, affordance,
            expectation,
            efficiency. </p>

        <h2>User Survey</h2>
        <p>I conducted a survey to understand the needs of users. This survey was sent out through social media accounts, subreddits, and friends.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="marginbottomsmall">
        <p>The main purpose of this survey was to answer the following questions:</p>

        <ul class="listspace">
          <li>
            <p><b>1. Ideal target group for a new cloud service product?</b></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>2. How are people using such a service now? and Why?</b></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>3. What features do they use regularly?</b></p>

            <p><b>4. What problems can I solve with a new product?</b></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="red underline"><b>Key Takeaway</b></p>
      <p>The most critical thing that I learned during the survey was more than new features, users are concerned about the usability of basic features</p>
      <p class="marginbottomsmall">When users were asked what they DO NOT like about their present service, these were their responses.</p>
      <ul class="squarelist listspace marginbottomsmall">
        <li>
          <p>I didn't know how to create a folder for a long time</p>

        <li>
          <p>Difficult to understand, so I don’t use much</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Saved it in the wrong folder and couldn’t find it</p>
        </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p class="red aligncenter">All these led to the same problem - Unintuitive Design <br>
        Not having an intuitive user flow that helps the user to move from one step to the other without any friction is the concern among cloud storage users</p>

      <p class="red underline marginbottomsmall"><b>Other Key Points<p>

      <h2>Defining the Solution</h2>
      <p>Based on the competitive analysis and user survey, I identified the possible characteristics of a new entrant.
      </p>
      <ul class=" listspace">
        <li>
          <p>1. A service that’s ideal for workplace-related activities.</p>

          <p>3. Focused on providing an intuitive workflow.</p>

      <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>To understand the user better, I developed two personas based on two clear usage motivations that stood out during the survey. </p>

      <p class="bold underline">Main change after usability testing</p>
      <p class="flonoheadcomp">When the user hovers over a file, it gets highlighted along with the actions they could perform with that file. But I learned during the test that the hovering feature was confusing and the users found it difficult to
        click the ‘Move’ button
        .
        So I decided to remove the hovering option.</p>

          <p class="red marginbottomsmall">Users found it confusing as there were two buttons ‘Share’ and ‘Done’. I thought it would make it easier for the user to have access to the share button close to the input field. But the test
            proved
            otherwise so I decided to get rid of the
            ‘Share’ button.

      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>The prototype was tested again to find out how users responded to the various visual elements. I had to make one last change based on the usability testing before finalizing the design. </p>

        <p class="red margincenter aligncenter">In the modal window, users were trying to click the ‘upload’ button before necessary selections were made. I think the issue here is that the ‘Upload’ button is always in the active mode which confuses
          the user as to whether the necessary
          selections were made or not. So I reduced the opacity of the button and once a selection is made, it changes to 100%.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>It was a rewarding experience to design a product from scratch. Though the direction wasn’t clear in the beginning, each step added clarity and helped me to get closer to the final prototype. While there are still a lot of possibilities to
          explore, I believe this is a good start.
        </p>
        <p>A few insights during the usability tests were particularly surprising. Some of the elements which I thought would make the process easier didn’t work. But eventually, it helped me design an even better solution to the user’s pain points.
        </p>
        <p>If I had more time, I wouldn’t have considered doing another round of usability testing to test the final changes I made to the prototype.</p>
